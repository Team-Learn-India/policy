The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise defined.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, we may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. However, we do not collect any personal data directly. Any information requested will remain on your device and is not collected by us.

## Cookies

The app itself does not use cookies. However, third-party services used in the app may use cookies to improve their services. You can accept or refuse these cookies through your device settings.

## Service Providers

We may engage third-party companies for:

- Facilitating the Service

- Performing Service-related tasks  
- Assisting in usage analysis

These third parties may have access to your Personal Information solely to perform assigned tasks and are obligated not to use it for any other purpose.

## Security

We strive to protect your information using commercially acceptable methods but cannot guarantee absolute security.
